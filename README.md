# PasswordGenerator
Hello. This is an app that generates a password using the "random" module in python. The app asks you if you how long you want the password to be and if you want numbers and/or uppercase letters in the password and then generates it for you. I am still somebody who is learning python and is in no way an expert. GUI might come at some point if I choose to learn Tkinter.
